CalMate is a smart and simple way to track your daily calorie intake. Using the power of Google's Gemini AI, you can simply take a picture of your food, and CalMate will handle the rest.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Food Recognition:** Snap a photo of your meal, and our AI will identify the food and automatically log the calories for you.
*   **Detailed Meal Logging:** Keep a comprehensive log of all your meals and snacks throughout the day.
*   **In-depth Analysis:** Get insights into your eating habits with our detailed calorie and nutrient analysis.

## How It Works

CalMate uses Google's powerful Gemini AI to analyze the images of your food. When you take a picture, the image is sent to our AI model, which identifies the food items and estimates their calorie and nutritional information. This information is then automatically added to your daily meal log.
